        TAMID at Northeastern was founded in 2015. Generally, all 60 TAMID
        chapters operate similarly with a few variations unique to each chapter.
        TAMID at Northeastern was the first chapter to start a Tech Consulting
        track, pioneered by Harrison Hur. In addition to competing in TAMIDâ€™s
        global stock pitch competition, we also manage our own portfolio of
        securities.

      />
      <p>
        Our chapter also has six committees (Education, Recruitment &
        Membership, Fund, Professional Partnerships, Social Events, and
        Marketing & Design) which help us operate on a larger scale. Lastly,
        TAMID at Northeastern has always been a pioneer with our Education
        process and the global Education curriculum is largely based on our
        curriculum.
